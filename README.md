# Supernova Temperatures
Use the data from the ASCII files on https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova/SNarchive.html.

Anything before 1995 needs to have its flux scaled up by 10^20.

The program fits spectra from the website mentioned above with Planck's Law to determine the surface temperature of the supernova each day that it was observed. 

To take into account redshift use the table on page 93 of Optical Spectroscopy of Type Ia Supernovae 1 by T. Matheson and friends.
